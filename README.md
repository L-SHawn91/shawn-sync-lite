## SHawn OSS stack role

This repository is an **early-stage public-safe scaffold**. APIs are unstable. It supports the SHawn EvidenceMap flagship rather than replacing it.

## Public boundary

This repository is a clean public-safe projection. It contains only schemas, templates, toy data, public metadata adapters, mock executors, and public reports.

It must not contain private databases, private manuscripts, PDFs, private corpora, local/internal paths, Discord identifiers, workflow logs, memory exports, credentials, or private project state.

## Quick start

```bash
python -m pip install -e .[dev]
python -m pytest -q
python scripts/public_safety_scan.py .
```

## Status

Early public scaffold for OpenAI/Codex OSS maintainer evidence and public-safe SHawn OSS release gates.
